# Utils
A collection of utility functions and scripts I use.  

## Installation 
The package is uploaded on PyPi, therefore it can be installed via
```bash
pip install haran-utils
```
I've tested the package only on python3.6+. It may or may not work with older versions.

## Image scripts
These are a set of cli scripts related to image housekeeping. The syntax is - 
```
utils image <command> <args>
```
You can use the `-h` arg to get help on the specific command
### List of available commands
1. `crop` - Crops images given in one folder and outputs to the target folder
2. `filter` - 
Checks the resolution of all the files in the specified directory and moves them to the target directory if they are of a larger resolution
1. `summarise` - Checks the resolutions of images in all the sub-directories of the given directory and tells how many of images of a given resolution are there in a sub-directory. The image below is an output from the command.
